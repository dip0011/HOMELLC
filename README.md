## Assumptions/liberties
I have completed all the necessary functionality for this assignment. I have not spent much time on creating a high-level UI, instead, I focused more on the functionalities. Please take a look and I have also included a demo video in the Demo folder.

## Updates
I enhanced functionality as per the instructions, introduced features, and corrected bugsÂ in the previous version. Also included an updated demo video inside the demo folder for better understanding.
